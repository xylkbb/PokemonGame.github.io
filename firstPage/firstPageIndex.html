        a gracious card awaits at the bottom of the page. <br>
        There, you may humbly admit defeat and unveil the answer in a flourish of resigned curiosity.<br>
        <br>
        And lo! If the name dances on the tip of your tongue like a Butterfree in spring, yet remains just out of reach, <br>
        a Hint button shall be at your service—bestowing upon you a clue most enlightening, to nudge your thoughts toward destiny.<br>
        <br>
        Now go forth, valiant hunter of Pokémon! May your wit be sharp and your Pokédex ever-growing.<br>
